# waterledger
App for logging water consumption and to remember to drink water.
This application uses a Redux Pattern.
It uses Firebase to handle the backend, analytics, and authentication.
It is built in flutter. The app was developed for android, but can easily be released on iOS 
as well with some slight tweaks. 
Link the play store listing: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bobbyjones.waterledger
BTW the app on the store may not actually work. I minified the code using proguard and it broke the app.
I undid some but not all of the minification due to size constraints. I am currently not able to test the latest release
due to my android device being destroyed on the day of release. So if you guys test the release please leave an issue if 
it does not work as expected thanks.
